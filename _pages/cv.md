# Research Experiences

## Partial Feature Selection and Alignment for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation -- May.2020 ~ Jun.2021

- Unified issues of "partialness" to a more generalized Multi-Source Domain Adaption (MSDA) task as Multi-Source Partial Domain Adaption (MSPDA) and proposed a novel model termed Partial Feature Selection and Alignment (PFSA) to cope with both MSDA and MSPDA scenarios.
- Employed a feature selection vector based on the correlation among the features of multiple source domains and the target domain and designed three effective feature alignment losses to align the features by preserving the domain information of data sample clusters in the same category and discrimination between different classes.
- Extensive experiments conducted on three prevailing MSDA datasets exhibited that the model outperformed the state-of-the-art MSDA and PDA methods in both MSDA and MSPDA tasks.

# Projects

## Artificial intelligence poet system -- Dec.2019 ~ Feb.2020

- Project GitHub: [https://github.com/Fyy10/AI-Poet](https://github.com/Fyy10/AI-Poet)
- Constructed a model to automatically write Chinese poems.
- Implemented the model in Python with PyTorch as the deep learning framework.
- Applied NLP techniques including RNN, LSTM, CharRNN model, Seq2Seq model, and Attention Mechanism.
- Trained the model on a GTX 1050 Ti graphic card and released the trained model on GitHub.

## Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition -- Jan.2020 ~ Feb.2020

- Assignment GitHub: [https://github.com/Fyy10/ML-DL_Practice/tree/master/cs231n](https://github.com/Fyy10/ML-DL_Practice/tree/master/cs231n)
- Improved my programming skill and understanding of computer vision through finishing Stanford CS231n assignments that covered topics including K-nearest neighbor algorithm, fully-connected networks and convolutional networks, generative adversarial networks, and style transfer.

## Applications and challenges of Artificial Intelligence -- Sept.2020 ~ Nov.2020

- Project GitHub: [https://github.com/Fyy10/Python-Playground/tree/master/AI](https://github.com/Fyy10/Python-Playground/tree/master/AI)
- Learned fundamental concepts and acquired skills in artificial intelligence including decision tree (ID3 algorithm), backpropagation in neural networks, fully connected networks for MNIST classification, LeNet for CIFAR10 classification, and VGG16 for flower classification.
- Led a team of 4 to attend the Kaggle Competition (Kannada-MNIST), where I managed to implement the designed models in Python utilizing PyTorch, and delivered the defense presentation.

## The Sieve of Prime Numbers and N-Body Simulation (Paralleled Computing) -- Mar.2021 ~ May.2021

- Project GitHub: [https://github.com/Fyy10/Parallel_Computing](https://github.com/Fyy10/Parallel_Computing)
- Implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm using MPI (Message Passing Interface).
- Computed the number of primes smaller or equal to the given number N using the MPI algorithm with three optimized approaches, which eventually achieved significant improvement in performance.
- Simulated the gravity interactions and the motions of 4096 bodies with CUDA C and reached more than 1500x speedup compared with sequential code on the target machine.
